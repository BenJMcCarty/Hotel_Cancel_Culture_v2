# Hotel_Cancel_Culture_v2


**Revisiting the Hotels**

Previously used this dataset for a classification project with the goal of modeling the likelihood of a given reservation canceling.

<u>New ideas include:</u>
1. Time Series Modeling: uni- and multi-variate forecasts
2. Classification: classify whether a reservation will actualize ("CheckedOut"), no-show, or cancel.
3. Regression: ADR; number of service requests; number of cars parking
4. Reducing to features known only prior to arrival (meals, parking, etc.)
